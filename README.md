# Newyear-Tasks_webapps
These are basic web application projects using the open-source python based web framework, django. I've created these simple web apps to initiate myself to django.
## setup  
Clone the djproject folder then:
- `cd (folder's directory)`
- `python manage.py runserver` 
and then navigate to this URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/(insert app name)`.

NOTE: You should've already installed django
## exploration 
The code in relation to the content of the web apps is made in such way to make it easy to understand once browsed and looked at, that's why i provided little to no comments in the code.
## contribution
Feel free to contribute and play around with the code to fit your own taste.
